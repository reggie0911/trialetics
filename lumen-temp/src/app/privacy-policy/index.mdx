# Privacy Policy

At Lumen, we are deeply committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the highest standards of data security. We understand that your trust is fundamental to our relationship, and we take our responsibility to safeguard your personal information seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, process, and protect your data when you interact with our platform, services, and website. By using Lumen's services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this policy and consent to our data practices as described herein.

When you create an account with Lumen, we collect essential information such as your name, email address, company details, and billing information to provide you with our project management and analytics services. We also automatically collect technical data including your IP address, browser type, device information, and usage patterns to optimize your experience and ensure platform security. Additionally, as you use our features like team collaboration tools, project tracking, and AI-powered insights, we may collect data about your interactions, preferences, and workflow patterns. This information helps us personalize your experience and improve our service offerings to better meet your needs.

We use your personal data primarily to deliver our core services including project management tools, analytics dashboards, team collaboration features, and AI-powered insights through our Plasma AI technology. Your information also enables us to communicate with you about service updates, security notices, billing matters, and new features that might benefit your workflow. We may analyze usage patterns and performance metrics to enhance our platform's functionality and develop new features. Additionally, we use your data to provide customer support, resolve technical issues, and ensure compliance with legal obligations and our terms of service.

Lumen implements industry-standard security measures including encryption, secure data transmission, regular security audits, and access controls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. We store your data on secure servers with multiple layers of protection and employ strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access your information when necessary for service delivery. Our security protocols are continuously updated to address emerging threats and maintain the highest level of data protection. In the unlikely event of a data breach, we commit to notifying affected users and relevant authorities promptly as required by applicable laws.

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. We may share your data only with trusted service providers who assist us in delivering our services, such as cloud infrastructure providers, payment processors, and customer support platforms, all of whom are bound by strict confidentiality agreements. We may also disclose your information if required by law, to protect our rights, or in connection with a business transaction such as a merger or acquisition. When sharing data with third parties, we ensure they maintain adequate security measures and use your information only for the specified purposes.

You have full control over your personal data and can access, update, or delete your account information at any time through your Lumen dashboard settings. If you wish to export your data, suspend your account, or permanently delete your information, you can contact our support team or use the self-service options available in your account. For users in the European Union and other applicable jurisdictions, you have additional rights including data portability, the right to object to processing, and the right to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities. We respond to all data subject requests within the timeframes required by applicable privacy laws.

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, services, or legal requirements. When we make significant changes, we will notify you via email or through prominent notices on our platform before the changes take effect. We encourage you to review this policy regularly to stay informed about how we protect your privacy. Your continued use of Lumen's services after policy updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at [privacy@lumen.com](mailto:privacy@lumen.com).
