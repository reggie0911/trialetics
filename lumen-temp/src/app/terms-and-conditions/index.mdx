# Terms and Conditions

Welcome to Lumen, your comprehensive platform for project management, team collaboration, and AI-powered business insights. These Terms and Conditions govern your access to and use of our services, platform, and all related features including our Plasma AI technology and analytics tools. By creating an account, accessing our website, or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these terms. If you disagree with any part of these terms, you must discontinue use of our services immediately.

Lumen provides a comprehensive suite of business productivity tools designed to optimize workflows, enhance team collaboration, and accelerate organizational growth through intelligent insights and analytics. Our services include project management capabilities, team collaboration tools, configurable observability features, AI-powered analytics through Plasma AI, and various integrations to streamline your business processes. We continually enhance our platform with new features and improvements, and these terms apply to all current and future services we offer. Access to certain premium features may require subscription to specific service plans as outlined in our pricing structure.

To use Lumen's services, you must create an account by providing accurate, complete, and current information including your name, email address, and company details. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account, including actions by team members you invite to your workspace. You must promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any security breaches, and you agree to provide us with reasonable assistance in investigating any such incidents. You may not share your account with others outside your organization or use multiple accounts to circumvent service limitations.

You agree to use Lumen's services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these terms, our Privacy Policy, and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations. You may not use our services to store, transmit, or distribute content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, or violates the rights of others. You are prohibited from attempting to gain unauthorized access to our systems, reverse engineer our software, or interfere with the proper functioning of our platform. Additionally, you may not use our services to compete with Lumen or develop competing products or services.

All intellectual property rights in Lumen's services, including our software, algorithms, AI technology, user interfaces, designs, and content, remain the exclusive property of Lumen and our licensors. You retain ownership of the content and data you upload to our platform, but you grant us a limited license to use, store, and process your content solely to provide our services to you. This includes using anonymized and aggregated data to improve our AI algorithms and platform functionality, always in accordance with our Privacy Policy. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on our services without explicit written permission.

While we strive to provide reliable and uninterrupted service, Lumen is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that our services will be error-free, secure, or continuously available, and we may experience downtime for maintenance, updates, or unforeseen technical issues. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lumen shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of our services. Our total liability to you for any claims related to our services shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve months preceding the claim.

You may terminate your account at any time by following the instructions in your account settings or by contacting our support team. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account immediately if you violate these terms, engage in fraudulent activity, or use our services in a manner that could harm other users or our platform. Upon termination, your access to our services will cease, but these terms will continue to apply to your prior use of our services. We will provide you with reasonable notice before termination unless immediate termination is necessary to protect our platform or other users.

We may modify these Terms and Conditions from time to time to reflect changes in our services, business practices, or legal requirements. When we make material changes, we will notify you via email or through a prominent notice on our platform at least thirty days before the changes take effect. Your continued use of our services after the effective date of any changes constitutes your acceptance of the modified terms. If you disagree with any changes, your sole remedy is to terminate your account before the changes take effect.

These terms are governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction] without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of our services will be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of [Arbitration Organization], except for claims that may be brought in small claims court. You and Lumen agree to waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in class action lawsuits. If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
